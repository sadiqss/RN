                        <span class="make-bold">Long Way Home:</span> Its a thriller by EVA Dolan. Though it was an old
                        book, I found it on a local
                        Sunday Market. So dramatic and if you are a thriller lover you can give a read.

                        Booker. The book is about crime thriller. All the way dramatic.

                    Year 2021 was entirely suffocating for the travel freak. Almost whole year international travel was
                    ban,
                    though at the end I made some solo tour to the local beaches and forest.

                    Though the covid was cruel in every possible way it gave us some time to work from home. During this
                    time I worked in different modelling software namely Matlab for transportation model. For heat flow
                    simulation I learned star CCM and Solid works. All of that brings new knowladge and new idea for
                    future work.
